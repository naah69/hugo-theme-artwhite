# Clean White v0.2 by Naah Theme for Hugo

CleanWhite is a clean, elegant, but fully functional blog theme for Hugo. Here is a live [demo site](http://www.naah69.com) using this theme.

It is based on [Clean WhiteTheme](https://github.com/zhaohuabing/hugo-theme-cleanwhite).

## Quick Start
1.Go to the directory where you have your Hugo site and run:

```
$ mkdir themes
$ cd themes
$ git clone https://github.com/naah69/hugo-theme-cleanwhite.git
```

 If your site is already a git project, you may want to choose to add the cleanwhite theme as a submodule to avoid messing up your existing git repository.

```
$ mkdir themes
$ git submodule add https://github.com/naah69/hugo-theme-cleanwhite.git themes/hugo-theme-cleanwhite
```

2.copy all files in themes/hugo-theme-cleanwhite/requiredFile and paste to your project.

3.Run  Hugo Build-in Server Locally
```
$ hugo server --buildDrafts
```
Now enter [`localhost:1313`](http://localhost:1313) in the address bar of your browser.


## Configuration
First, let's take a look at the [config.toml](https://github.com/naah69/hugo-theme-cleanwhite/blob/master/requiredFile/config.toml). It will be useful to learn how to customize your site. Feel free to play around with the settings.

### Comments
The optional comments system is powered by [Changyan](https://changyan.kuaizhan.com/). If you want to enable comments, create an account in Changyan and write down your config.

```toml
#畅言评论配置
#changyan comment config
changyan_enable = false
changyan_appid = ""
changyan_conf = ""
```
You can disable the comments system by changyan_enable.

### Site Search with Algolia
1.Follow this [tutorial](https://forestry.io/blog/search-with-algolia-in-hugo/#3-create-your-index-in-algolia) to create your index in Algolia. The index is just the storage of the indexing data of your site in the the cloud . The search page of CleanWhite theme will utilize this indexing data to do the search.

2.Go to the directory where you have your Hugo site and run the following commands,it need node.js environment:
```bash
$ npm install hugo-algolia -g
```

3.Next, create new file named config.yaml, and add the following:
```yaml
---
baseurl: "your baseurl"
DefaultContentLanguage: "zh-cn"
hasCJKLanguage: true
languageCode: "zh-cn"
title: "your site title"
theme: "hugo-theme-cleanwhite"
metaDataFormat: "yaml"
algolia:
  index: "your algolia index"
  key: "your algolia admin key"
  appID: "your algolia appID"
---
```
4.Next,configuration your algolia in config.toml
```
algolia_search = false
algolia_appId = ""
algolia_indexName = ""
#search key
algolia_apiKey = ""
```

5.Go to the directory where you have your Hugo site and run the following commands,it need java environment:
```bash
$ java -jar naah-algolia-builder-0.0.1.jar
```
Algolia index output format has already been supported by the CleanWhite theme, so you can just build your site, then you’ll find a file called algolia1.json in the root, which we can use to update your index in Algolia.
Generate index file:
```bash
$ hugo
```
Create a new file in the root of your Hugo project called .env, and add the following contents:
```bash
ALGOLIA_APP_ID={{ YOUR_APP_ID }}
ALGOLIA_ADMIN_KEY={{ YOUR_ADMIN_KEY }}
ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME={{ YOUR_INDEX_NAME }}
ALGOLIA_INDEX_FILE={{ PATH/TO/algolia.json }}
```
Now you can push your index to Algolia by simply running:
```bash
$ npm run algolia
```
Add the following variables to your hugo site config so the search page can get access to algolia index data in the cloud:
 ```
algolia_search = true
algolia_appId = {{ YOUR_APP_ID }}
algolia_indexName = {{ YOUR_INDEX_NAME }}
algolia_apiKey = {{ YOUR_ADMIN_KEY }}
```
Open search page in your browser: http://localhost:1313/search

### Analytics

You can optionally enable Google or Baidu Analytics. Type your tracking code in the

```toml
googleAnalytics = "UA-XXXXX-X"
ba_track_id  = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
```
Leave the `googleAnalytics`  or 'ba_track_id ' key empty to disable it.
